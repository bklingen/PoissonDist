## Poisson Distribution

* [x] Create ui with navbarPanel and three tabs "Explore", "Find Probabilities", "Find Quantiles"
* [ ] Explore tab: 
  * [x] Have slider for lambda (display as greek letter) in ui
  * [ ] Allow to see table of Poisson probabilities (use datatables becasue it allows for easy browsing?)
  * [x] Graph reactes to lambda slider by showing shape of Poisson distribution as lambda changes; need to fix (hold constant) X -axis to get effect
